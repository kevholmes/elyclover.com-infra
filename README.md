# elyclover.com-infra

Pulumi project written in Go with multiple stacks for dev, staging, prod support.

This uses an existing Billing Account/DNS Resource Group created outside of IaC at this time.

## Purpose

This will replace the GH Pages hosted version of elyclover.com that
lives [here](https://github.com/kevholmes/elyclover.com).

The goal is to have multiple environments for elyclover.com [dev, stg, prod] that are
deployed to via GitOps-like principles using GitHub Actions automation workflows.

- PRs to the web repo are built and deployed to <dev.elyclover.com>
- Release Candidates (PRs generated by Release-Please automation workflows) are deployed to <stg.elyclover.com>
- Releases with Semantic Versions generated by merging Release Candidate PRs into main are deployed to <elyclover.com>

Pulumi state is currently managed in [Pulumi Cloud](https://app.pulumi.com/kevholmes/elyclover.com-infra).

## Stack overview

1. Create a unique Azure Resource Group per Pulumi Stack, e.g.: dev stack gets a dev Resource Group with globally unique ID.
2. Create a unique Azure Storage Account and enable static web hosting sourced from the Blob Container `$web`
3. Create an Azure CDN Profile with some sane defaults.
4. Create an Azure CDN Endpoint and point it at our Storage Account's Endpoint, taking care to ensure we set the proper Origin Header
to support tie-in to the Storage Account and keep Azure security policies happy.
5. Get the ref to an external Azure-hosted DNS Zone in another Resource Group created outside of this Pulumi code. Set as Pulumi config options
`dnsResourceGroup` and `dnsZoneName`.
6. Create either a CNAME (if nonprod e.g. `dev.tld.com`) or an apex A record (if prod e.g. `tld.com`) in this upstream `dnsResourceGroup`/`dnsZoneName` in Azure DNS.
7. Set up a Custom Domain for our Azure CDN Endpoint previously created in step #4. This takes a while (~5-60 min) and will auto-provision a TLS certificate
for the record created in step #6. This might fail at times and need another `pulumi up` to get it over the line. Pulumi does not appear to support an easy "native" retry
here as they put the onus on the providers to handle such things with their own logic.

## Usage

```bash
pulumi stack ls
# pick a stack
pulumi stack select dev
pulumi up
```

## SOPS usage

This is preliminary. There are no "secrets" in here yet. I will be importing the TLS keys later that are used
for the root domain CDN endpoint at <https://elyclover.com>, those will be SOPS encrypted at-rest and eventually imported by Pulumi
automatically in a fully automated pipeline when I get the time.

```bash
sops file.enc.yml
```

## pre-commit hooks

### ggshield

This will auto-detect any potential secrets before they make it into a commit.

The first time I ran this I had to auth like so:

```bash
# ggshield is located in a unique folder to each environment installed as a python venv by pre-commit tooling
# GGSHIELD=$(find ~/.cache -name ggshield | grep bin)
$GGSHIELD auth login
```
