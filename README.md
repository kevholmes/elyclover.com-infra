# elyclover.com-infra

Pulumi project with multiple stacks for dev, staging, prod.

This uses an existing Billing Account/DNS Resource Group created outside of IaC at this time.

## Purpose

This will ultimately replace the GH Pages hosted version of elyclover.com that
lives [here](https://github.com/kevholmes/elyclover.com).

Pulumi state is currently managed in [Pulumi Cloud](https://app.pulumi.com/kevholmes/elyclover.com-infra).
